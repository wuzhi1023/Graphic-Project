The dropdown menu shows main steps of the project. Use the water surface as a clipping plain, the wholescene is rendered 3 times, the first time is everything below the surface, in a frame buffer object as the refraction texture, the second time is everything above the surface, in a frame buffer object as the reflection texture, the third time is on the screen. Use the two textures above to draw the water. And then use a DUDV map and a corresponding normal map to add wave effect and reflecting sun light. Trees are wavefront objects, vertex shaders are used to make them move according to the wind.
